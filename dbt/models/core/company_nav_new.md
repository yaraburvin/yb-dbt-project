## Data Notes

1. **% ownership** = Fund NAV on specific date / Sum(Company valuations for that fund on the same date)
2. **Company NAV** = % ownership Ã— Company Valuation


## Key Observations

Values differ from the orginal calculation method. 
The data can be either highr or lower than in the original method, depending on how the fund is performing. Since fund_size is the latest fund_size and does not move with increase or decrease in valuation, the values will be less acurrate. The alternative approach tries to reflect the currrent economics.
