## Data Notes

1. **Commitments are always made before the first valuation**
2. **Ownership Calculation**: Fund ownership percentage is calculated as `total_commitment_amount / fund_size` based on commitments made up to the first valuation date
3. **Company NAV Aggregation**: Final company NAV is the sum of `fund_nav_in_company` across all funds that have invested in that company
4. **Ownership**: Ownership percentages remain constant, as the fund size is recorded as the latest value
